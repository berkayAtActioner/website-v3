## About Actioner

Actioner is the AI execution layer for revenue teams. We pull context from emails, meetings, and your systems, then turn it into deal and account intelligence you can act on — with receipts.

### What is Actioner?

Actioner is a B2B SaaS product that helps revenue teams (Account Executives, Account Managers, Customer Success Managers, and Sales Leaders) run predictable revenue motions with evidence-backed insights. Unlike generic AI tools that only see what you paste, Actioner connects to your full deal context — emails, meetings, CRM data, support tickets, and more — to provide actionable intelligence.

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Deal Intelligence**: Automated deal briefs with evidence from all touchpoints
- **Automated CRM Updates**: Keep your CRM current without manual data entry
- **Evidence-Based Forecasting**: Forecast conversations grounded in reality with visible "why"
- **Account Health Monitoring**: Proactive signals about renewal risks and expansion opportunities
- **Next Best Action Recommendations**: Clear guidance on what to do next, backed by evidence
- **Churn Risk Detection**: Early warning signals for at-risk accounts

### Who is Actioner For?

1. **Account Executives (AEs)**: Close more deals, type less. Get prioritized actions and automated CRM updates.
2. **Account Managers (AMs)**: Renew and expand with confidence. Surface renewal risks and expansion signals.
3. **Customer Success Managers (CSMs)**: Stay proactive. Detect churn risks and track onboarding progress.
4. **Sales Leaders**: Forecast with receipts. Evidence-based pipeline visibility and team performance.

### Core Beliefs

- AI should remove admin, not add process
- Context wins — if AI can't see the whole deal, it can't help you run it
- Trust needs receipts — every insight should point back to the source
